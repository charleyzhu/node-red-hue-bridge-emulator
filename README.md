# node-red-hue-bridge-emulator
A Hue Bridge emulator, primarily for use with and Amazon Echo

There are several versions of a Hue Bridge Emulator available written in Java, and this
project seeks to make a native node-RED version for use at home on e.g. a Raspberry Pi,
and enable easy integration with MQTT and anything else you want to trigger off the back
of events being posted.

Some of the initial configuration XML templates came from https://github.com/armzilla/amazon-echo-ha-bridge/ ,
which was heavily complemented by WireShark packet captures
